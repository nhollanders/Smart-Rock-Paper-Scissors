# Smart:Rock Paper Scissors
## What?
Its rock paper scissors with a few changes, the bot has 3 difficultys each increasing into being unbeatable.
First will give it a random output every time, Second difficulty will make it try to guess what you are most likely to pick based on your last 10 turns, and the last just forces a win by knowing what you choose making it impossible.

## There nothing more...
Thats about it, feel free to reference it incase your looking for examples of code even though my code expecially in C++ may not be the best in terms of practices.
